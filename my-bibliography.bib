abstract = {We present the first parallel fixed-parameter algorithm for subgraph isomorphism in
planar graphs, bounded-genus graphs, and, more generally, all minor-closed graphs
of locally bounded treewidth. Our randomized low depth algorithm has a near-linear
work dependency on the size of the target graph. Existing low depth algorithms do
not guarantee that the work remains asymptotically the same for any constant-sized
pattern. By using a connection to certain separating cycles, our subgraph isomorphism
algorithm can decide the vertex connectivity of a planar graph (with high probability)
in asymptotically near-linear work and poly-logarithmic depth. Previously, no sub-quadratic
work and poly-logarithmic depth bound was known in planar graphs (in particular for
distinguishing between four-connected and five-connected planar graphs).},

abstract = {We present a parallel k-clique listing algorithm with improved work bounds (for the
same depth) in sparse graphs with low degeneracy or arboricity. We achieve this by
introducing and analyzing a new pruning criterion for a backtracking search. Our algorithm
has better asymptotic performance, especially for larger cliques (when k is not constant),
where we avoid the straightforwardly exponential runtime growth with respect to the
clique size. In particular, for cliques that are a constant factor smaller than the
graph's degeneracy, the work improvement is an exponential factor in the clique size
compared to previous results. Moreover, we present a low-depth approximation to the
community degeneracy (which can be arbitrarily smaller than the degeneracy). This
approximation enables a low depth clique listing algorithm whose runtime is parameterized
by the community degeneracy.},

abstract = {This paper presents a largely improved version of the VF2 algorithm for the Subgraph Isomorphism Problem. The improvements are twofold. Firstly, it is based on a new approach for determining the matching order of the nodes, and secondly, more efficient — nevertheless easier to compute — cutting rules are proposed. They together reduce the search space significantly. In addition to the usual Subgraph Isomorphism Problem, the paper also presents specialized algorithms for the Induced Subgraph Isomorphism and for the Graph Isomorphism Problems. Finally, an extensive experimental evaluation is provided using a wide range of inputs, including both real-life biological and chemical datasets and standard randomly generated graph series. The results show major and consistent running time improvements over the other known methods. The C++ implementations of the algorithms are available open-source as part of the LEMON graph and network optimization library.}

Subgraph searching is an essential problem in graph databases, but it is also challenging due to the involved subgraph isomorphism {NP}-Complete sub-problem. Filter-Then-Verify ({FTV}) methods mitigate performance overheads by using an index to prune out graphs that do not fit the query in a filtering stage, reducing the number of subgraph isomorphism evaluations in a subsequent verification stage. Subgraph searching has to be applied to very large databases (tens of millions of graphs) in real applications such as molecular substructure searching. Previous surveys have identified the {FTV} solutions {GraphGrepSX} ({GGSX}) and {CT}-Index as the best ones for large databases (thousands of graphs), however they cannot reach reasonable performance on very large ones (tens of millions graphs). This paper proposes a generic approach for the distributed implementation of {FTV} solutions. Besides, three previous methods that improve the performance of {GGSX} and {CT}-Index are adapted to be executed in clusters. The evaluation shows how the achieved solutions provide a great performance improvement (between 70\% and 90\% of filtering time reduction) in a centralized configuration and how they may be used to achieve efficient subgraph searching over very large databases in cluster configurations.},

For this purpose, a watermark signature and an {IP}-Core behavioral description are translated into Finite State Machines ({FSMs}). Both {FSMs} are merged in a single one containing a watermarked {IP}-Core without disrupting its original functionality. Therefore, we tackle {NP}-completeness of the subgraph isomorphism problem found during {FSMs} merging process via a tailored {GA}. However, not deeply embedded states are a key problem that may ease watermark’s removal. To overcome this issue, a {FSM} reduction algorithm is also considered in the proposed watermarking scheme. Moreover, the proposed scheme also targets transitions regrouping which impact the amount of hardware resources usage and a mechanism for selecting the best watermarked {FSM}. A thorough empirical assessment shows a significant improvement in terms of reduction and watermark embedding strength.},
